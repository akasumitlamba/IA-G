2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K

Medium

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:
- The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
- The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
- A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010" (decimal 2).
    Other examples: "00100" (4), "00101" (5), all length 5.

Example 2:
    Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    "000001" is the longest subsequence making a binary number â‰¤ 1, length 6.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either '0' or '1'
- 1 <= k <= 10^9
